# CFO Note: Capital Pressure vs ESOP (Current Stage)

## Current reality
If occupancy is still low, your immediate challenge is runway and utilization, not cap-table complexity.

## Recommended order of action

1. **Stabilize operations first**
   - Improve occupancy and route economics.
   - Track per-trip contribution margin.

2. **Handle member cash needs cleanly**
   - Use a documented founder capital call **or** shareholder loans.
   - Keep records: amount, date, repayment or conversion terms.

3. **Use a small ESOP only if needed now**
   - If used at this stage, keep it small (e.g., 5–10% pool).
   - Use vesting (4 years, 1-year cliff).
   - Grant based on measurable contribution.

## Why this sequence
- ESOP is best for retention/alignment.
- It does not directly solve low occupancy or negative cash flow.
- Early over-dilution can hurt future fundraising flexibility.

## Practical governance checklist
- Founders agreement signed
- Capital contribution log maintained
- Board resolutions for any option pool
- Vesting policy documented before grants
